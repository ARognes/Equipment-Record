# Equipment-Record
## About
  This is a web-app that keeps records of where equipment has gone, who has them, and more.
 
## Functionality
  * Admins give users different authorities
  * Admins pay for the service
  

  Everything is namespaced under a business name.


  The main page must have a superb design so that everything is easily accessible.


  qr-code is the equipment-id





## Later TODO's (small things)

Load small images of the equipment, if user requests full images then they will be loaded.

Document ids are the hash of the name generated by sha256 import. The hash is sent to the
firebase function.
